## 🛠 Customization

You can freely tweak all timings and behaviors in `_internals/settings.py` if you want more freedom in doing so:

```python
AUTO_MODE_KEY = "u"         # key to enable auto-mode
FIRST_WAIT = 45             # wait after clicking "Ranked Match"
SECOND_WAIT = 80            # wait before enabling auto-mode
MATCH_DURATION = 780        # fallback time if HUD detection fails
SEARCH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 20  # how often to check match status
POST_MATCH_CLICKS = 20      # number of clicks to return to menu
```
